## FYI

- why not using stm32 HAL library? or STM32CUBE IDE?

    As my laptop is quite slow an IDE definetly will slow stressing me, and I like tweaking script file such as cmake/make/ninja
    instead of push a button and waiting for it to compile a bunch of file without knowing what happen make me afraid that I will be a bad programmer like how I write this sentences/paragraph.

    **Just kidding, I know how to write a *good english essay*.**

- why Clang instead of GCC?

    I just want to learn clang and later hopefully create custom llvm project. So using Clang will help me out figure things out.
